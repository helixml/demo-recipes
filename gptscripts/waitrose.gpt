args: user_id: The user_id we want to know about.
args: recipe_theme: The theme of the recipes.
args: number: The number of recipes to output.

Do the following steps sequentially and only write and read files as instructed:
  1. Run tool {recipe.query} to get a list of candidate recipes for the given user as a CSV file written to recipes.csv.
  2. Run tool {purchases.query} to get a list of the top 10 products most bought by the given user written to purchases.csv.
  3. Read files recipes.csv (the suggested recipes) and purchases.csv (the user's previous top purchase history) and output a JSON list of {number}, {recipe_theme} theme recipes that you think the user would like based on their purchase history.

Format the final output in a strict JSON format.
Format the output to display recipe details including name, summary, and image URL.
In the summary, justify to the user why they would like the recipe.
For example, say in the summary (not including parts in square brackets) "We thought you would probably like this recipe because you have previously bought cod and potatoes [previously purchased products]. It matches heart healthy [chosen theme] because [insert justification based on nutritional information]"

Output the exact image url from the CSV file, do not invent one. Output format:

\`\`\`json
[{
  "recipe.name": "name",
  "recipe.summary": "summary", 
  "recipe.imageurl": "imageurl"
}]
